I think one thing that's wonderful about this class is that it brings together CS seniors in a way we don't often get a chance to. I've never felt a lot of community in the major and I think the students in this class are mostly pre-dispositioned to be in a social or at least community-oriented mood, given that those are the ideals for the open source community. I think that it's interesting that we aren't encouraged to communicate, work with each other, or access the open web until what might be our last semester at the school. At least taking this exam in the spring, I notice a lot of these students are about to graduate, and I would be too if I wasn't doing a double major. The conflict between the CS student curriculums and the real working experience of engineers is something that I notice but don't have a solution for, yet. It's clear that in a technical subject like this, we need to make our own mistakes.

All of this is to say, that I enjoyed being in a class with semi-familiar faces, and I enjoyed the git exercise because I was allowed to ask for help from my peers without feeling like I was being academically dishonest. In my opinion, it's very important to engage in helping and soliciting help from your peers to maintain a good workplace culture, as the sentiment that you're working with talented and smart people can only help your motivation to continue building. I think allowing yourself to find awe in your peers is one of the reasons engineering works as an industry, not just startups. Engineering not only has the 'ability' to be collaborative, but it is also necessarily collaborative in my opinion. 

For the extension, I was impressed that one of my groupmates had already had a very ambitious extension before. I started my coding journey when I was really upset that Spotify links weren't opening in the app, and just in the web browser (this must have been in 2016). I taught myself a very minimal amount of javascript to parse and redirect myself using the Spotify link format and ran it on my computer for around three weeks until Spotify added an 'open in app' button. Thankfully, that first extension didn't require any API use, just a conversion from 'play.spotify.com/x/y' to 'spotify:x:y' or something like that. For my group, we are currently trying to decide if we should build on one groupmates ambitious prior project or start something from scratch. I think something simple that modifies the html or CSS of the page is a good idea.
