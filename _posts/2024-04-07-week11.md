On GitLab: I had genuinely never seen the actual product until we had joined the project, just marketing slush. They really should publicize the UI instead of using large words and like, that moving line thing that every git product does. I can’t watch another animation of a line forking into a branch, out of a branch, then merging, and, like going up to the cloud. Dude, we get it. Continuous integration, yes, okay thanks.

But! The second I asked for permission to contribute, a developer from the community success team literally directly emailed me. I mean, his name is ‘Lee Tickett’, so he might be a bot. And his message is basically exactly similar to the one he sent Harry and Dan, but I really enjoyed it. He told me to fill out my profile, which was fun, and asked me what type of contributions I wanted to do. Which was great! It ensures that everyone involved with the community has a profile picture and a location, a LinkedIn, etc. And THEN, he sent me a link with issues that I could work on, which was, genuinely, a godsend. 

There was like 30,000 total issues I could have started working, but Lee sent me two links that filtered them down with the first contributor/easy win, and then from there frontend or backend. And I just started scrolling, which was honestly way more fun than scroling through issues on GitHub. I actually already like this more a little. This immediately makes more sense to me than Github does.
