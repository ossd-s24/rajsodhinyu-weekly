title: W2 Code of Conduct
---

I personally place a lot of emphasis on collective ownership and cooperation, and a CoC aligns with these principles by promoting a space where everyone feels valued and respected. Without a Code of Conduct, there may be concerns about the potential for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment within the project, which goes against my ideals.

While no system is perfect, and challenges may arise, the existence and enforcement of a Code of Conduct are generally seen as essential for cultivating a collaborative and respectful environment within open source projects.

In terms of enforcing rules listed in a Code of Conduct, the realistic implementation depends on several factors. The effectiveness of enforcement relies on the commitment of the project maintainers and community members to uphold the principles outlined in the CoC. Transparency, accountability, and a well-defined process for reporting and addressing violations are crucial components.

Open Source Codes of Conduct also bristle right up against the questions of how we should treat each other online. A hotly contested topic in my opinion: what do we owe each other online? It's a weirdly deep question for GitHub politics, but it's true. Freed from the confines of actual interaction, we can be brutal, uncaring, and apathetic online without consequence. 

So, how should we act? And what should those consequences be? It's a Lockesian endeavor, acting like we can make a new society inside of the society people already exist in. And as time goes on, historically compeltely anonymous platforms like Reddit and github are becoming interlinked with our real-world selves, meaning that actions in the virtual world have in-person consequences. Even one of the CoC that we read today in class clarifies that people can be removed for real world actions that the mods (called stewards for lord knows what reason) decide are unbecoming. 

Similarly, how do we reckon with giving anonymous people power over our communities? Their presence claims to prevent abuse in the community, but who is preventing the community from moderator abuse? If the 'average internet moderator' (an assumption whose truth should be questioned) is a 30 year old in his mother's basement, how does this person command respect. The labor speaks for itself in a faux society: we respect the moderator because 'he' spends 40 hours a week for no pay. But does this 'dedication' to the cause allow 'him' to establish moral authority?
