title: W4 Browser Extensions
---


With the browser extension, the implementation was not super complicated, and I wanted us to have a unique project. I have a long background in Graphic Design, Animation Design, and visual effects so I thought it would be interesting to apply my unique skills to my group's project. I also know that using icons from other places can be dicey, and I appreciate when things are made in-house.

 I first started with creating a color scheme for the popup window, and then, being annoyed that the icon wasn't visible on the Dark Firefox window. Then, I wanted to make a cool icon, but I couldn't decide on what the best icon would be. I realized that I could let the class decide, and hence would get to practice using the issues and discussion features. There were some bugs around which icon would show because of the Firefox cache, I think, and that was annoying to deal with. Sam and Andrew are incredibly talented and I really appreciated their input on what the icons should be and the API work that Andrew did was very impressive. 

 As far as the other teams, I was impressed with the persistent timer in one of the timer groups and the creativity of the StudyTools group. I think extensions can be and should be fun! The internet used to be fun.
