I'm super excited to also be involved with the *Pulsoid* app community. I started talking to some people online about an integration between a heartbeat sensor and the app *TouchDesigner*, which is an audio-visual art interface used by the ITP types. That is to say, me!

*TouchDesigner* is basically a visual programming language used for 'real-time interactive multimedia experience', so interactive immersive installations and live visuals. It allows someone to read DATA and then manipulate and generate DATA (visuals, audio, and data) in real-time using  a node interface. I love my use of DATA here, because I think it's really fitting. 

Fundamentally, the experience of using TouchDesigner is like being in the matrix for me. Everything becomes numbers, and then everything becomes measurable, and then everything becomes mathable, and then everything can be exported, extrapolated, and measured against each other, and everything can then be displayed. *All mediums become other mediums through numbers, so audio can become a video, and vice versa, heartbeats can become audio and video, which can change the heart rate, which can change itself again.* The idea is to use a heartbeat sensor to change the music, which changes the heartbeat, which changes the music. My dancer had the idea to put the heartbeat sensor on a viewer watching the dancer, which is a good idea. Further mediating!!
